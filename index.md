    of the OEE calculation.

  service_para: The Idle state indicates that the machine has stopped, but ShopFloorConnect
    does not (yet) know why. Idle time is converted to downtime or changeover when
    the machine operator selects a downtime reason. When OEE is calculated, any unconverted
    Idle time it treated as Unplanned Down

  service_para: The machine is stopped, the reason for the stoppage has been reported
    to ShopFloorConnect, and the reason had been previously assigned to the Unplanned
    downtime state. Unplanned downtime causes the OEE software to reduce the “Availability”
    percentage.

  service_para: The machine is stopped, the reason for the stoppage has been reported

    (Setup)state. The ShopFloorConnect OEE software allows the user to decide whether
    Changeover is logged as planned or unplanned downtime. When logged as unplanned
    downtime, the OEE software will reduce the availability percentage for any Changeover
    time logged by the system.
