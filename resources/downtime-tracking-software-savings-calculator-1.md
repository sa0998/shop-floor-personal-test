  anticipated_machine_downtime_heading: Anticipated Machine Downtime Reduction Effort
  anticipated_machine_downtime_para: "<p>The main purpose of ShopFloorConnect is to
    identify the sources of inefficiency, especially machine downtime. The amount
    of money you will save over time by implementing ShopFloorConnect will depend
    in large part on how aggressively you intend to work at reducing machine downtime.
    On our “[Savings Calculator”](https://www.shopfloorconnect.com/downtime-tracking-software-roi)
    page, there is an “Anticipated Downtime Reduction Effort” pull down selection
    with four options. The options, and their impact on the savings calculation, are
    described below:</p>"
anticipated_machine_downtime_details:
- anticipated_machine_details_heading: Minimal
  anticipated_machine_downtime_details_para: "<p>A Minimal downtime reduction effort
    does not involve any direct machine downtime tracking, instead, it typically consists
    of nothing more than notifying the machine operators that ShopFloorConnect tracking
    software has been implemented, and deploying one or two large-format displays
    to show the uptime status of your machines in real time for everyone to see (using
    ShopFloorConnect’s Factory Viewer Equipment Summary). Our experience has shown
    that such an implementation usually results in a 5% reduction in machine downtime.
    In other words, if your current machine utilization is 60%, then your machine
    downtime is 40%. A 5% reduction will bring it down to 38%. This 5% reduction in
    downtime will be used to calculate the savings.</p>"
- anticipated_machine_details_heading: Moderate
  anticipated_machine_downtime_details_para: "<p>When “Moderate” is selected, we base
    the calculation on a 10% reduction of your current machine downtime. So if your
    current machine utilization is 65% uptime/35% downtime, a Moderate Downtime Reduction
    effort will cause a downtime decrease of 3.5% (10% of 35), reducing downtime from
    35% to 31.5% and increasing machine utilization % from 65% to 68.5%.<br>Such an
    increase is easily realized when operators use the ShopFloorConnect Machine Interface
    machine downtime tracking menu to identify the real reasons for downtime, and
    you begin to pick off some of the “low-hanging fruit” on the less efficient machines.
    In addition, real-time displays such as ShopFloorConnect’s Performance Summary
    allow personnel to quickly spot under performing machines, enabling more timely
    corrective action.</p>"
- anticipated_machine_details_heading: 'Focused '
  anticipated_machine_downtime_details_para: "<p>When “Focused” is selected, we base
    our savings calculation on a 15% reduction of the current downtime. Typical downtime
    reduction efforts in a “focused” program are the same principles described under
    the “moderate” program, but with more stringent and widespread application throughout
    the factory.</p>"
- anticipated_machine_details_heading: Aggressive
  anticipated_machine_downtime_details_para: "<p>For an Aggressive program, we base
    our saving calculation on a 20% reduction in the current downtime. So if your
    machine utilization is currently at 60%, an aggressive approach to machine downtime
    reduction can increase that to 68%. This is accomplished with a full application
    of ShopFloorConnect’s downtime tracking and reporting functions, real time displays,
    and the Alert feature to immediately notify the appropriate personnel each time
    a machine stops for a prolonged period of time.</p>"
