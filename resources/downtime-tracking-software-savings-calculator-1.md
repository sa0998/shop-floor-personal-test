    The main purpose of ShopFloorConnect is to identify the sources of inefficiency, especially machine downtime.

    The amount of money you will save over time by implementing ShopFloorConnect will depend in large part on how aggressively you intend to work at reducing machine downtime.

    On our “[Savings Calculator”](https://www.shopfloorconnect.com/downtime-tracking-software-roi) page, there is an “Anticipated Downtime Reduction Effort” pull down selection with four options. The options, and their impact on the savings calculation, are described below:

    A Minimal downtime reduction effort does not involve any direct machine downtime tracking, instead, it typically consists of nothing more than notifying the machine operators that ShopFloorConnect tracking software has been implemented, and deploying one or two large-format displays to show the uptime status of your machines in real time for everyone to see (using ShopFloorConnect’s Factory Viewer Equipment Summary).
    Our experience has shown that such an implementation usually results in a 5% reduction in machine downtime. In other words, if your current machine utilization is 60%, then your machine downtime is 40%. A 5% reduction will bring it down to 38%. This 5% reduction in downtime will be used to calculate the savings.
