description: An auto parts manufacturer was able to improve OEE and cut downtime in
  half with ShopFloorConnect
success_stories_details_heading: Manufacturer Trades Labor for Machine Uptime
success_stories_details_para: "<p>An automotive parts manufacturer’s Downtime Reports
  indicated that his coil-fed stamping presses were experiencing a combined average
  of 60 hours per week of downtime for raw material replenishment. The average cost
  of downtime on these presses is approximately $200 per hour.</p><p>Until ShopFloorConnect
  was installed, this downtime went largely unnoticed because coil changes are part
  of the standard operating procedure when running these types of machines. ShopFloorConnect
  indicated that the downtime was 3 times greater than what the user expected based
  on previous time studies.</p>"
success_stories_details_heading_2: ShopFloorConnect Installation
success_stories_details_para_2: "<p>The previous time studies did not take into account
  the time that the machine operator had to spend locating material and operating
  a crane to position the coil for installation. ShopFloorConnect did.</p><p>Based
  on this information, the manufacturer was able to justify hiring a junior setup
  person to monitor the area (using ShopFloorConnect’s Factory Viewer) to identify
  the machines that were due for a coil change, then locate the material and stage
  it so that the operator could quickly replenish the machine when the old coil ran
  out.</p><p>The end result was a downtime reduction of 66%. The manufacturer traded
  40 hours of labor at $25/hour for 40 hours of uptime worth $200/hour.</p>"
