success_stories_details_heading: Fabricator Realizes Huge Cost Savings
success_stories_details_para: "<p>Impulse Manufacturing is an elite full-service metal
  fabrication company located in Dawsonville, Georgia. A perennial member of Fabricator
  Magazine’s “Fab 40” list of top metal fabrication companies, Impulse offers a wide
  range of capabilities from simple laser cutting services and high volume stampings
  to complex weldments and assemblies.</p><p>Since you can’t improve what you don’t
  measure, when Impulse wanted to reduce downtime, they started with ShopFloorConnect.
  ShopFloorConnect measures uptime, downtime, reasons for downtime, as well as production
  counts, and displays the information in real time throughout the factory.</p>"
success_stories_details_heading_2: Before ShopFloorConnect
success_stories_details_para_2: "<p>“Before we installed ShopFloorConnect, we had
  a difficult time ascertaining why a particular machine was down” says Clay Reiser,
  Director of Business Development for Impulse Manufacturing, “And downtime on the
  floor translated directly to lost productivity and lost dollars on our bottom line.”</p><p>Impulse
  has over 35 machines connected to ShopFloorConnect including press brakes, welders,
  2-D lasers, saws, tube lasers, a paint line, and punch presses.</p><p>In addition
  to the real-time “Visual Factory” displays, ShopFloorConnect automatically generates
  customized downtime and OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) reports.</p><p>“After
  the initial installation, we saw an instantaneous 10% increase in productivity on
  our shop floor”, Reiser said, “That translated into a payback of less than 3 months.”</p>"
