server_recommendations_details: "<p>The following hardware and software recommendations
  apply to a typical ShopFloorConnect installation.</p><p>The specifications below
  represent a general recommendation only. These specifications may need to be modified
  for larger or multi-plant installations. Always consult factory support for exact
  hardware recommendations.</p><p><em>* ShopFloorConnect can be installed with the
  “free” Express version of SQL 2016 at no additional charge. The performance of the
  Express version of SQL is usually acceptable up to about 40 machines, but may degrade
  as additional machines and or users are added, or when report delivery frequency
  increases. Either version of the database can optionally be installed remotely from
  the ShopFloorConnect data collection/IIS server</em></p>"
