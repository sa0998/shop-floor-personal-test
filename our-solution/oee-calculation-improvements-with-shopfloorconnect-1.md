  oee_calculation_improvements_para: 'Traditional Overall Equipment Effectiveness
    (OEE) is a well-established method for tracking process efficiency. An OEE calculation
    is based on the formula:'
  oee_calculation_improvements_bold_text: Availability x Performance x Quality = OEE
  oee_calculation_improvements_para_2: It factors in those three variables and displays
    a simple percentage that shows the ratio of actual machine output to its theoretical
    maximum.
  how_traditional_oee_main_heading: It factors in those three variables and displays
    a simple percentage that shows the ratio of actual machine output to its theoretical
    maximum.

calculation_variables:
- variables_main_heading: Availability
  variables_icon_class: flaticon-factory
  variables_para: Accounts for unplanned downtime losses. Availability It is equal
    to the actual machine/process running time divided by the total available time.
    Planned downtime events such as lunch breaks are not part of the OEE calculation.
- variables_main_heading: Performance
  variables_icon_class: flaticon-settings
  variables_para: Accounts for speed loss. Performance in the OEE calculation is equal
    to the ratio of number of parts produced over the measurement period (shift, day,
    etc) to the theoretical maximum number of parts that could be produced if the
    machine or process ran at its highest possible speed. This is called the Machine
    Ideal Rate.
- variables_main_heading: Quality
  variables_icon_class: flaticon-worker
  variables_para: In traditional OEE calculations, quality is the ratio of good parts
    to total parts produced.
