reports_details_para: "<p>ShopFloorConnect production monitoring software has a powerful
  browser-based reporting feature that allows you to configure and generate reports
  on demand, or to set up schedules to automatically deliver pre-configured reports.
  The ShopFloorConnect Standard Reports are templates that can be configured to include
  data from a specified time period, also from specific machines, operators, part
  numbers (or other important parameters depending on machine type), and/or shift.
  The individual machine monitoring reports have a number of report-specific configurable
  parameters called “filters” that control the report content.</p><p>ShopFloorConnect
  production monitoring software includes the following machine downtime tracking
  and OEE report templates:</p>"
