reports_details_para: "<p>ShopFloorConnect production monitoring software has a powerful
  browser-based reporting feature that allows you to configure and generate reports
  on demand, or to set up schedules to automatically deliver pre-configured reports.
  The ShopFloorConnect Standard Reports are templates that can be configured to include
  data from a specified time period, also from specific machines, operators, part
  numbers (or other important parameters depending on machine type), and/or shift.
  The individual machine monitoring reports have a number of report-specific configurable
  parameters called “filters” that control the report content.</p><p>ShopFloorConnect
  production monitoring software includes the following machine downtime tracking
  and OEE report templates:</p>"

  sfc_reports_para: "<p>he Downtime Summary tracks reasons for downtime by machine.
    You have the option to include either a pie or Pareto chart, and sort the machine
    downtime reasons by number of occurrences or by duration.</p><p>The Downtime Summary
    has report filters that allow you to include only specified machine states, as
    well as the standard ShopFloorConnect report filters. This machine downtime tracking
    report can be set up to display one machine/graph per page, or to consolidate
    multiple machines into a single report.</p>"

    contains a bar chart that shows the amount of machine downtime for selected downtime

    reasons appear in the graph.</p>"

    of the selected machines compared to the Standard Uptime Efficiency for each machine.
    If the machine meets or exceeds the standard, the table row background is green.
    If the machine is not meeting the standard, the background is red. This machine
    monitoring feature enables users to tell at a glance which machines are underperforming.</p><p>This
    report has machine and date range filters, as well as a setting to specify whether
    the table will be sorted alphabetically, by actual production efficiency, or by
    efficiency compared to the standard uptime (as shown in the example).</p>"
