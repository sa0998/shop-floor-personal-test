Automatically send alert messages when machines are down

![Alerts](/uploads/2020/09/02/woman-ipad-industrial-_istock_small.gif "Text Alerts")

ShopFloorConnect now has the ability to automatically generate conditional alerts from any machine.

Each alert is a custom text or email message that is sent to selected recipients whenever preset conditions are met at a machine. The alerts can be used to notify an operator when an unattended machine has stopped running, to alert management when a critical customer job goes down, or to summon specific resources when specific conditions exist at a machine – such as automatically notifying a fork lift driver when a scrap bin needs to be replaced.

ShopFloorConnect can generate multiple alerts for each machine, and will select recipients according to their individual work or shift schedules.

This feature provides ShopFloorConnect users with a new set of tools to improve productivity. Because they can respond more quickly to each event, manufacturers have been able to significantly reduce downtime – even on machines where further process-related downtime reduction was considered cost-prohibitive.
