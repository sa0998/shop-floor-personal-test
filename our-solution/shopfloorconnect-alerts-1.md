alert_main_heading_bold: ShopFloorConnect now has the ability to automatically generate
  conditional alerts from any machine.
alert_main_details: "<p>Each alert is a custom text or email message that is sent
  to selected recipients whenever preset conditions are met at a machine. The alerts
  can be used to notify an operator when an unattended machine has stopped running,
  to alert management when a critical customer job goes down, or to summon specific
  resources when specific conditions exist at a machine – such as automatically notifying
  a fork lift driver when a scrap bin needs to be replaced.</p><p>ShopFloorConnect
  can generate multiple alerts for each machine, and will select recipients according
  to their individual work or shift schedules.</p><p>This feature provides ShopFloorConnect
  users with a new set of tools to improve productivity. Because they can respond
  more quickly to each event, manufacturers have been able to significantly reduce
  downtime – even on machines where further process-related downtime reduction was
  considered cost-prohibitive.</p>"
