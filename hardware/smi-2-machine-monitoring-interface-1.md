  machine_interface_details_para: "<p>Job and operator information can be entered
    into the SMI 2 using the on-screen keypad or by a bar code or other scanner connected
    to one of the SMI 2’s on-board USB ports. Job tracking enables ShopFloorConnect
    to apply ideal production rates specific to a part or process, which makes OEE
    calculations more accurate.</p><p>The SMI 2 is available either with an enclosure
    or as a panel-mount.</p><p>The SMI 2 features a downtime selection menu that takes
    full advantage of the touch-screen interface to streamline operator input. The
    SMI 2 also has an additional “Setup” input that allows ShopFloorConnect to appropriately
    log any time spent doing troubleshooting and setup even if the machine is cycled.</p>"
