machine_monitoring_details_para: "<p>The ShopFloorConnect Machine Interface (SMI 2)
  is the fastest way to connect virtually any machine to the ShopFloorConnect Machine
  Monitoring Software. The SMI 2 is network-ready and factory configured to drop right
  in to your existing ShopFloorConnect installation and begin collecting data.</p><p>The
  SMI 2 is a vital part of the ShopFloorConnect Machine Monitoring System. With just
  a few simple connections, the SMI 2 automatically tracks uptime and production count
  data from any machine, and provides it to ShopFloorConnect. The SMI 2 features a
  user configurable machine-specific downtime reason list so that operators can indicate
  the reason for each significant machine stoppage.</p>"

  machine_interface_details_para: "<p>Job and operator information can be entered
    into the SMI 2 using the on-screen keypad or by a bar code or other scanner connected
    to one of the SMI 2’s on-board USB ports. Job tracking enables ShopFloorConnect
    to apply ideal production rates specific to a part or process, which makes OEE
    calculations more accurate.</p><p>The SMI 2 is available either with an enclosure
    or as a panel-mount.</p><p>The SMI 2 features a downtime selection menu that takes
    full advantage of the touch-screen interface to streamline operator input. The
    SMI 2 also has an additional “Setup” input that allows ShopFloorConnect to appropriately
    log any time spent doing troubleshooting and setup even if the machine is cycled.</p>"
