**The ShopFloorConnect Machine Interface (SMI 2) is the fastest way to connect** [**virtually any machine**](/machine-monitoring-interface.html) **to the ShopFloorConnect Machine Monitoring Software. The SMI 2 is network-ready and factory configured to drop right in to your existing ShopFloorConnect installation and begin collecting data.**

The SMI 2 is a vital part of the ShopFloorConnect Machine Monitoring System. With just a few simple connections, the SMI 2 automatically tracks uptime and production count data from any machine, and provides it to ShopFloorConnect. The SMI 2 features a user configurable machine-specific downtime reason list so that operators can indicate the reason for each significant machine stoppage.

Job and operator information can be entered into the SMI 2 using the on-screen keypad or by a bar code or other scanner connected to one of the SMI 2's on-board USB ports. Job tracking enables ShopFloorConnect to apply ideal production rates specific to a part or process, [which makes OEE calculations more accurate](/oee-calculation.html).

The SMI 2 is available either with an enclosure or as a panel-mount.

The SMI 2 features a downtime selection menu that takes full advantage of the touch-screen interface to streamline operator input. The SMI 2 also has an additional “Setup” input that allows ShopFloorConnect to appropriately log any time spent doing troubleshooting and setup even if the machine is cycled.
